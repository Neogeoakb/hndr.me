There are more-or-less 2 programmers working on this project, an iOS programmer working on an iPad app and an iPhone app, and myself working on the server backend and the data analysis front-end. I said &amp;#8216;more-or-less&amp;#8217; because there was another guy working on an Android app, but he currently is working on another project, also, while I do spend the majority of my time working on the project, I am also involved in several other clients&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is supposed to be launched by the end of this month, but I personally don&amp;#8217;t think the project is anywhere close to production-ready. Despite this, we keep adding features. The main target market of the product is small business owners, and I do understand why these features might be necessary, but I can&amp;#8217;t help but feel that we should stop adding features and focus on making the existing features to be ready for&amp;nbsp;production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently reading a book by &lt;a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/"&gt;37 Signals, Getting Real&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend it to anyone who writes software for a living to read it. Its not a technical book, so no need to open up your text editor to try out a code snippet from the book.I haven&amp;#8217;t finished reading it yet, but the content has been really great so far. It is full of valuable insights on running a software business and designing product. But, the whole fifth chapter on Feature Selection really resonates with me because I have been thinking about what adding features to a software product really&amp;nbsp;means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hidden cost of a new feature mentioned in the book is feature&amp;nbsp;loop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, be on the lookout for feature loops (i.e. features that lead to more features). We&amp;#8217;ve had requests to add a meetings tab to Basecamp. Seems simple enough until you examine it closely. Think of all the different items a meetings tab might require: location, time, room, people, email invites, calendar integration, support documentation, etc. That&amp;#8217;s not to mention that we&amp;#8217;d have to change promotional screenshots, tour pages, faq/help pages, the terms of service, and more. Before you know it, a simple idea can snowball into a major&amp;nbsp;headache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is exactly what I&amp;#8217;ve been experiencing working on the project. Adding a stock keeping feature leads to inventory features which leads to keeping track of invoices which leads to keeping track of suppliers and so on and so&amp;nbsp;forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that might not seems much, from the technical persepective, adding a feature often involve more than just coding up the feature. Coding up a new feature by itself is not much work, but one thing to keep in mind is that these features rarely work in isolation. That means, programming the feature doesn&amp;#8217;t only require us to write the code for the new feature, it also means that we need to test it. Not just the new features either, we need to be sure that the few lines of new code doesn&amp;#8217;t break any existing feature. Those are just code, if the change involve changing the database schema, pulling in new dependencies, or having to coordinate with an additional process that would make things even more&amp;nbsp;complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially changes in database schema. The ideal database schema that can accomodate the new feature often aren&amp;#8217;t backward compatible, it often breaks stuffs in the unexpected places. Also, keeping the backword compatibility while adding hacks on top of hacks to accomodate the new features are even worse, it is basically keeping an active time bomb&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these hidden costs adds up, too. Almost like compound interest, you need to make sure not to break existing features when implementing a new one, and when you have added the new feature, that would be one more thing that you need to make sure not to break when adding another feature. All that makes maintaining the code harder. Maintainance doesn&amp;#8217;t just mean fixing bugs, it also means that while you are fixing a bug, you need to make sure that you don&amp;#8217;t end up breaking stuff in other place, and do a favor for your future self and make sure the code stays easily modifiable so that future you can do the same thing. Also, while doing all these make sure to keep the code clean and isolated so that you don&amp;#8217;t end up with a stack of jenga of a code in the first&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent experience makes me think how great would it be if I invested some time to build an automated test infrastructure early in the development process. Of course an automated test won&amp;#8217;t help you to prevent breaks if the code itself is built like a house of cards, but it does help so that you don&amp;#8217;t have to manually test all the features by yourself, not to mention that it is not unusual at all for us to miss several parts of the project while performing the&amp;nbsp;test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to summarize up, while working on a software project that doesn&amp;#8217;t have a clear specification and changes all the time, help your future-self and have an automated test infrastructure. Follow the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOLID&lt;/span&gt; principles while writing your code, and keep your classes isolated from each&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUT&lt;/span&gt;, all of that will not help if new features keep being added all the time. While working on project, with deadlines and features being added and removed all the time, having things break are almost unavoidable. So, as the book says, the best thing is to say No. Keep only the features that are essentials, and make sure these features works really, really well. As mentioned in the book, Steve Jobs once&amp;nbsp;said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Innovation] comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don&amp;#8217;t get on the wrong track or try to do too much. We&amp;#8217;re always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it&amp;#8217;s only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;

During the past 6 months, I have been doing a bunch of various things, and also learned a lot of stuffs that I have never really thought&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the main reason I am writing this post right now is simple: I am procrastinating. I have several conference videos that I wanted to watch, and also several libraries and frameworks that I want to try out, but for some reason, my mind keeps drifting away. This week, three developers I work with left the company, one of which is the person who mentored me during my internship with them. I have known about the departure a few weeks prior, and I didn&amp;#8217;t actually thought about it much, but it turns out, the departure of these colleagues does affect me quite a bit. I thought I am used to changes, but it seems like I&amp;#8217;m not. It made me think about stuffs. Stuffs that are hard to put in writing, stuffs that are uncomfortable to think&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, most of my work now revolves around the back end, I had to learn a bunch of stuffs on server administration, distributed architecture, and I also ended up using the Laravel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; framework a lot. Which is actually very fun and exciting, until something blows up and data are lost, that is. Anyway, all that stuffs that I learned during the period makes for a lot of materials that I wanted to write up, but for various reasons (mainly me being lazy), I never ended up getting to it. While using the static site generator is excellent in terms of simplicity, it also meant that I have to open up my text editor and generate a new site even just to post a short draft. I considered migrating my site to &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;, but having to manage a server pushed me sticking with Pelican. What I do now is to write my drafts in Evernote, and then paste them here when it is ready, which isn&amp;#8217;t exactly a seamless process considering Evernote&amp;#8217;s lacking support for Markdown. That being said, I do hope it would help me to write&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>2014 - thoughts</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/2014-thoughts" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-01-29T14:33:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2014-01-29:blog/2014-thoughts</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s rather late for a new year posting, considering we are almost entering the second month 2014 by now, but well, what can I say, I haven&amp;#8217;t got much time to write the past few months, and now I am only writing because I&amp;#8217;m stuck waiting for the next ferry back to my hometown that isn&amp;#8217;t coming for 2&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 is pretty special for myself. New years are usually a chance to start something for most people, a fresh start, where any unpleasant things that has happened happened &amp;#8220;last year&amp;#8221;. That said, for most people, these words are simply figurative speech. While the calendar has indeed changed, most people&amp;#8217;s live didn&amp;#8217;t, and life still goes on as usual. I myself have never really celebrated new year as anything other than a chance to get together with friends and do some catching&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 is different. Quite a lot has changed in my life in the past few months. I recently graduated from university, with that, I also started a new job as a software&amp;nbsp;engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s pretty much it. And wow, it&amp;#8217;s sounds pretty trivial now that I think about it. But still, a new year usually calls us to reflect about past events. I have been thinking about what kind of person I&amp;#8217;ve been, what kind of person I want to be, what I want to do in my life, pretty much my life direction in&amp;nbsp;general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back about myself, there are many things that I wish I&amp;#8217;d done differently. Especially during my university years. I was too much of a coward to take more risk in pretty much everything. People who I didn&amp;#8217;t take the chance to know more about, trips to places I didn&amp;#8217;t travel to, skills I didn&amp;#8217;t spend more time learning, and many others. I wasted too much time doing things that I didn&amp;#8217;t really care about just because they are things I&amp;#8217;m comfortable&amp;nbsp;with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t want to sound too arrogant, but I was one of those guys who didn&amp;#8217;t study much, yet still managed to get high scores in class. I honestly didn&amp;#8217;t find the works for my bachelor degree to be too difficult, and I find as long as I pay attention during classes, the only time I would need to study outside of classes would be a day or two before an exam. Because of this I ended up with a lot of free time. But I stupidly spent all these free time doing things like watching movies, surfing the web aimlessly, and other time wasting activities in general. I regretted not using those free times that I had to socialize more, join a student organization or two, learn how to play one or two instruments, and so on. I used to see my friends who seemed to barely have any free time and think what is it about this cozy university life that takes up so much of his time. Well, the answer is simply he made the most of his time in university. I used to think that university life is way too easy and boring. Well, how can it be not easy and boring, I did it&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I am no longer a student, I am consciously trying to be more active and socialize more. It&amp;#8217;s not easy though, I am your average geek and an through and though introvert, and meeting new people isn&amp;#8217;t my forte, but I am trying, and hopefully this will help me find what I want to do in&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I would like to change is my health. I have been obese as far as I can remember, and now that I have a full time job as a programmer, I can&amp;#8217;t think of any reason that would somehow magically change. I need to start taking responsibility of my health, and not make excuses for me failing to lose weight. I am going to buy a bicycle when I get back from my leave (yes, typical. Always start someday in the future. Seriously though, I&amp;#8217;ll stick to this plan), and I&amp;#8217;ll start commuting to work with my bike. Hopefully this would push me to exercise&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In work, while I do love what I do, and the work environment is awesome, it&amp;#8217;s not all rainbow and unicorns either. In my first project, I had to work with an existing system that well, let&amp;#8217;s just say it&amp;#8217;s difficult to work with. I myself also committed a big mistake in another project, I chosen a technology stack that no one else seemed to be interested in learning. I personally do love and believe in this stack (and I do think that the way we have been programming needs some serious improvement), which is why I chose it, but I came to learn that in a collaboration project I need to consider more than just the technical merit. I need to consider the people I&amp;#8217;ll be working with, and how comfortable they are in learning these things. The project ended up behind schedule, mostly because other in my team aren&amp;#8217;t comfortable with the new (not that new though) technology yet, and me being too much of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCD&lt;/span&gt;, spent way too much time than I should have cleaning up codes that other people just wrote. Lesson learned. Shipping should comes first before technical aesthetic. Save the beautiful code (not that I am really capable of writing code that good anyway :P) for personal&amp;nbsp;projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, when I was applying for jobs several months ago, I had several offers that comes with higher salary than the one that I accepted (my current job). The reason I took on this job is because I felt that I can learn the most about tech with this environment, and since this is my first job anyway, I didn&amp;#8217;t really think of looking for a position with the highest salary so that I can stay for years earning more money. The opportunity to learn. That was what I thought I should be looking for in my first job. But now, I am worried that I maybe forming a bubble around myself to get comfortable and not challenging myself. So that&amp;#8217;s another thing that I should work&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, well, I am still looking for what I want to do in life, but well, for starter, I would love to be able to travel more, get to know more people, hopefully I am able to find people dear to me. While I am an introvert, I do have several close friends that I value very much, but to be honest, the people that really matters to me are my family. For some reason I feel like it&amp;#8217;s not supposed to be this way, and I should have more people that I care about. I don&amp;#8217;t know, I guess this is just one of those things that I would know when the time&amp;nbsp;comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On traveling, well, I have been wanting to travel for several years, but for the past few years, as a poor student living on a scholarship, it&amp;#8217;s not really financially feasible. Not to mention the traveling cost, event the some of visa application fee would&amp;#8217;ve cost me a month&amp;#8217;s living cost. Now that I am working and earning a salary, I hope to be able to save up some money and travel somewhere. Even though visiting the old European cities have been on my mind for quite a while now, I don&amp;#8217;t really have a place that I want to visit yet. It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter where, I am still looking for a place that would pull me&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the life goal, well, I thought about it a lot, but I still can&amp;#8217;t find an answer that I am satisfied with. I guess this is just one those things that you can&amp;#8217;t rush. Well, there is no need to rush it anyway. Some people spend their whole life looking for a destination without finding one, maybe there isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#8217;s goes for my 2014 reflection. I don&amp;#8217;t really want to make another new year&amp;#8217;s resolution as my 2012 and 2013 resolution aren&amp;#8217;t completely crossed out yet, so here is my 2014 &amp;#8220;goal&amp;nbsp;guidelines&amp;#8221;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise more, start commuting to work with the bike, lose at least&amp;nbsp;15KGs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be more active, socialize more, don&amp;#8217;t get trapped in the comfort&amp;nbsp;zone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a new project, stick to it, and make it something that&amp;nbsp;counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop taking life so seriously. It&amp;#8217;s just&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it, I guess. Ah, of course, I didn&amp;#8217;t really include any geek topic so far, so I guess I should mention some. Well, I plan to do another re-design for this site, make new Pelican theme. Let&amp;#8217;s see how that goes. I also plan to rewrite the &lt;a href="https://github.com/hdra/WP_Mog"&gt;Mog WordPress theme&lt;/a&gt;, clean up the codes, and maybe build it on top of one of the popular &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; framework so that it&amp;#8217;s more&amp;nbsp;maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>New stage in life</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/new-stage-in-life" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-11-16T19:47:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-11-16:blog/new-stage-in-life</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I posted anything. The last time I posted something was in August, so it has been around two months. Since then, many things have&amp;nbsp;changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had my last day in college on July. I had my convocation ceremony on October, so yep. I am officially holding a B.Sc. degree. It was pretty exciting. Also, now I am working as a Software Engineer! I am now officially a professional programmer. I write code for a living. I also just moved to a new place today, so things has been very hectic in the past few months. From the job search, tying things up with my scholarship, looking for a place to rent, starting a new job, all these things has been taking up most of my&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last project I worked on was the WordPress theme that I uploaded on &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/mog/"&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;, and thankfully the support email has slowed down ever since the theme was moved from the featured themes. I haven&amp;#8217;t even been spending my free time coding that much. Lack of proper workspace and my dying laptop are what I would blame, but I guess I was kind of tired with all the changes that are happening as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am rather excited this new stage of life, and I hope I can learn more from my job and the people around&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A Tiny bit on Firefox Extension</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/a-tiny-bit-on-firefox-extension" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-08-20T14:33:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-08-20:blog/a-tiny-bit-on-firefox-extension</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I stumbled on &lt;a href="http://coryg89.github.io/technical/2013/08/13/how-to-create-your-own-chrome-extensions/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article on creating Chrome extension, and really, it seems really simple to do build an extension for the browser. So, I thought what would it take to build the same thing for&amp;nbsp;Firefox?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, it is pretty simple as well, but when you are just getting started, find out where to get started aren&amp;#8217;t really straightforward. The getting started documents aren&amp;#8217;t exactly well organized. To start with, there are two different ways to build an add-on for Firefox. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XUL&lt;/span&gt; tool set, and also, the new Add-on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/"&gt;add-ons developer page&lt;/a&gt; highlights the Add-on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt;, but the links below mostly deal with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XUL&lt;/span&gt; tools. The difference between the two can be found on &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/guides/sdk-vs-xul.html"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, the Add-on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt; is the one that is simpler, the documentation can be found &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, once you found the documentation, everything should be pretty easy to follow. Mozilla provides &lt;a href="https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/"&gt;Add-on Builder&lt;/a&gt;, a web-app that allows you to build add-ons for Firefox, but I prefer to download the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt; to my computer and use my preferred text editor. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt; is basically a python environment setup with everything you need to build an add-on, so you would need to have python installed on your computer. Whichever method you chose, the method are basically the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building the&amp;nbsp;Add-on&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, moving on to building actual add-on. Like the example in the post linked above, it is a  simple add-ons that adds a context menu that allows you to search &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MDN&lt;/span&gt; for the selected text. To be honest, I am not sure what to write in this post, because it is much more simpler than I&amp;nbsp;thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Chrome extension, a Firefox add-on is built with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; and Javascript. There is a &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; that contains the meta-data of the add-on that is a generated for you anyway. Your code will mainly goes to the &lt;code&gt;main.js&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;lib&lt;/code&gt; folder of your add-on directory. You can put your extra data, such as to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; files, extra javascript libraries, images, etc in the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; folder. All these folders are generated automatically with the initialization of the add-on, along with a &lt;code&gt;doc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; folder, which pretty much describe&amp;nbsp;themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the whole code for the&amp;nbsp;add-on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextMenu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;sdk/context-menu&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tabs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;sdk/tabs&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;self.on(&amp;quot;context&amp;quot;, function(){&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;    return &amp;#39;Search &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MDN&lt;/span&gt; for \&amp;quot;&amp;#39;+window.getSelection().toString()+&amp;#39;\&amp;quot;&amp;#39;;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;});&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;self.on(&amp;quot;click&amp;quot;, function(){&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;   self.postMessage(window.getSelection().toString());&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;});&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;menuItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextMenu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Search on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MDN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextMenu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;SelectionContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contentScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectionText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;https://google.com/search?btnI&amp;amp;q=site:developer.mozilla.org &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectionText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tabs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see there, there isn&amp;#8217;t much to do. The first two lines are the import statement to access some of the browser feature. Skip the &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; variable for now. Next, the we create a new context menu, give it a label, and we declare the context so that the item only shows up when there is a something&amp;nbsp;selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we pass the &lt;code&gt;contentScript&lt;/code&gt; argument, which defines the behavior of the menu item even further. Many things can be done through the &lt;code&gt;contentScript&lt;/code&gt;, such as to scope down the context even further, set the click behaviour, etc. The argument takes a string, and we passed the &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; variable as the argument. In this case, the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; event is are fired just before the context menu is displayed, and we change the label further to add the selected text. We also handles the &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt; event, and with it, we call the &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt; to pass the the selected text, which we handle with the function passed to the &lt;code&gt;onMessage&lt;/code&gt; argument, and in it, we open a new tab with the search&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might imagine, passing the script that defines the behavior of the add-on as a string literal isn&amp;#8217;t really nice when script is something a little more complicated. You can pass external javascript files to the &lt;code&gt;contentScriptFile&lt;/code&gt; argument to accomplish the same thing. Although there are several differences in the way the script is executed, but I won&amp;#8217;t go into it too much in this post. More on it &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/guides/content-scripts/loading.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more you can do with the add-on. You can scan through more features available on the documentation. There are more examples on the add-ons &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; repository. By the way, the add-on mentioned above is available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/hdra/ff-MDNSearch"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; as well. Also, the add-on we built here is just a simple plugin to show the basics of the Firefox plugin &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, not really meant for actual use. It doesn&amp;#8217;t handle plenty of use cases, and it also relies on Google&amp;#8217;s Feeling Lucky version to directly open the first search first result. so I don&amp;#8217;t really recommend you actually using it for anything&amp;nbsp;serious.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Programming"></category></entry><entry><title>When Noise Gets Too Much</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/when-noise-gets-too-much" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-07-11T23:15:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-07-11:blog/when-noise-gets-too-much</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The World Wide Web is an amazing thing. The amount of resources available on it is enormous. You can learn just about anything you can think of with these resources. Recently though, I noticed that amount of low quality content is getting way a lot&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until a few months ago, I collected almost everything I can get my hands on. I bookmarked every programming article I found that looked interesting, even though I barely know anything about the topic. When major tech conferences like Microsoft&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.buildwindows.com"&gt;Build&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/io/‎"&gt;Google I/O&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.pycon.org"&gt;Pycon&lt;/a&gt; were held, I scanned the videos for titles that looked interesting and downloaded them a bunch of them. I saved a bunch of videos from channels like Marakana or Google Tech Talks. I downloaded every single free programming books that people that people on sites like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HN&lt;/span&gt; or reddit, even though I don&amp;#8217;t know what the book talk about that much. As you may have guessed, only a very small portion of those bookmarks ever get visited for the second time, I barely watched any of the videos I downloaded, and most of the ebooks I downloaded never even got extracted from the zip&amp;nbsp;archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until Google announced the plan to shutdown Google Reader, I subscribed to a bunch of tech blogs, blogs like Techcrunch, or Gizmodo. Every morning, I would have 700+ new items on the reader, and I would scanned through all of them, click on what I find interesting, and mark everything else as read. It lasted for several months, but not only it was tedious, I started to realize many of their article are low-quality link-bait, not fact-based articles that fishes for stupid fan-boy arguments. I don&amp;#8217;t want to link to them for examples, but I am sure they aren&amp;#8217;t hard to&amp;nbsp;find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when Google Reader was shut down, I moved to [feedly][feed], and I took the chance to clean up my feeds. I use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; only to keep updated with some blogs of people whose writing I find interesting. Most of the are only updated occasionally, and I find myself reading almost every single one of them. The only tech blogs I follow are few that I find still publish actual professional news and pieces I enjoy reading, like &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;. I keep up with their updates selectively through channels like Twitter and/ or Facebook instead of trying to keep up with everything they&amp;nbsp;published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same case with the stuffs I kept on my hard drive. I deleted every videos and books that I find not too relevant because of the technology changes, or those that I found not too interesting after I went through them&amp;nbsp;briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt great. I feel much more relaxed. During the time I was living with these noises, I felt obligated to read or watch them. Now, not so much. Nowadays, I get my fix from channels such as Twitter, some highly-curated mailing-lists, also the top news on sites like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HN&lt;/span&gt; and Reddit. I also keep my reading list with Pocket, and keep track of my projects with Trello. It feels good not having to manage them myself (Yes, I know that these cloud services could be shut down any time, but I really hope they won&amp;#8217;t for anytime&amp;nbsp;soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, there is a downside to the abundance of information these&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt; Changed on my opinion on the news&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Setting up Development Environment with tmux</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/setting-up-development-environment-with-tmux" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-07-09T16:02:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-07-09:blog/setting-up-development-environment-with-tmux</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently just finished up my bachelor studies, and as I wait for the the convocation, I find myself not knowing what to work on. So,  between tying up loose ends with my scholarship sponsor, trying to score a freelance projects, and wasting time watching &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; series, I spent my time playing around with various web front-end frameworks and libraries without any particular aims. In doing this I ended up creating a bunch of throw-away projects, and I switch around between them randomly quite often. Often, I would have to run several commands to get everything up and running again, which would be easy if it involves only starting up an editor, but most of the time, I would have to type the same commands many times when I start working on a project. Of course, this doesn&amp;#8217;t only apply to this particular situation of me experimenting around with various tools, even when working on a more &amp;#8220;serious&amp;#8221; project, I can benefit from automating the setup of the development&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first idea that came to my thought is simply write a batch script to start the tools that I need, but I realize that this won&amp;#8217;t work well, since most of the tools that I are long running processes, such as a web server, or maybe &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; pre-compiler set to watch for changes in my project. Also, the log messages that these tools produce on the terminal are things that I would prefer to see. So, I would need a something that can help me to manage several terminal processes easily. The first thing that came to mind is &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt; Screen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read about terminal multiplexer and their use before, but this is the first time I thought of a use for them myself. So, I read around trying to look for how to use &lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt; to do the things I need, and it seems like there is a superior alternative to screen, which is &lt;a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/"&gt;tmux&lt;/a&gt;, so I switched my focus to it&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what tmux does is basically it allows me to easily run multiple programs in a single shell session , switch between them, and manage them from the parent terminal. It is almost like a terminal emulator within your terminal. Perfect for what I&amp;nbsp;needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most of my experiment projects, I usually have at least python web server, compass watch, and livereload server running. Instead of starting the one by one, with tmux, I automate it, and at the same time have them arranged neatly in their own window/ pane. I can start a new tmux session, label it, and detach from it with &lt;code&gt;tmux new-session -s my-dev -d&lt;/code&gt;. I can also pass a new command for it to run. For example, I want it to create a new v-split pane and run &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; in it, I can just enter &lt;code&gt;tmux split-window -v -t my-dev "top"&lt;/code&gt;. Awesome. For example, to create a tmux session with the setup consisting of python web server, livereload server, etc I mentioned above, I can just run these&amp;nbsp;script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmux&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8899&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmux&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;compass watch&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmux&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;guard&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmux&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tiled&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I would have all these 3 process running inside a detached tmux session in the background. If I ever need to see the log messages, I just run &lt;code&gt;tmux attach&lt;/code&gt; and have this shown to&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendra2392/9247967451/" title="Tmux screenshot"&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3694/9247967451_6169fb7941_c.jpg" width="800" height="433" alt="Tmux"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, If you prefer stay inside tmux, you can just leave out the &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; flag. You can also start a new editor inside it, create an empty tab for you run other commands on, almost anything that you can do on a terminal,&amp;nbsp;automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is awesome. But, you can automate it even further, and make your life even easier. &lt;a href="https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator"&gt;Tmuxinator&lt;/a&gt; is a tool that allows you to create and manage tmux session easily. You create project with &lt;code&gt;mux new project-name&lt;/code&gt;, and open the config with &lt;code&gt;mux open project-name&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;mux&lt;/code&gt; is an alias for tmuxinator). The config will look something like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# ~/.tmuxinator/project-name.yml&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nl"&gt;project_name:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;project_root:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;~/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;tabs:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;vim&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;layout:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vertical&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;panes:&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SimpleHTTPServer&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;compass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;watch&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;guard&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;plain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am sure I don&amp;#8217;t need to explain that file. It stores the configuration of the environment in an easy to write (and read) format, and you can start it with &lt;code&gt;mux project-name&lt;/code&gt; and it will create the session you need with the layout you need. You can read more about it in the project&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;README&lt;/span&gt; file. Tmuxinator obviously make something that make our job easier, even easier, but there is one caveat though. As you probably have noticed, tmuxinator is written in Ruby, and that means the tmux session it create will be a child process of Ruby, instead of your shell. You can read more what does this means &lt;a href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/05/10/from-the-desk-of-captain-obvious-tmuxinator-vs-scripted-configurations/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, tmux is powerful tools that can be used for more than just automating environment setup, I myself am still in discovering its capabilities. Search around for more information on customizing and using it, and of course, the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; page of the tmux itself is a great source of&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Setting up stuffs on Linux</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/setting-up-stuffs-on-linux" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-14T19:41:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-06-14:blog/setting-up-stuffs-on-linux</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My Linux system has been pretty much set up for most things I need, since of course, Linux Mint itself comes with a lot of stuffs such as python, and such. I myself am pretty surprised how much I have settled in. Still, there are still a number of stuffs that I need to add. First of, the utilities that includes stuffs such as gcc, cmake, curl, and all the&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;essential&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Python&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python 2.7 comes pre-installed on most Linux system, so there isn&amp;#8217;t much to do here. Python 3 has started to gain more traction these days, with a lot of projects has been ported to it, and some new ones that are written in it. The day where I would have to deal with Python versions aren&amp;#8217;t too far, but for now, I don&amp;#8217;t have much use for it yet, so 2.7 is good enough for me. I do need to install the development header for some of the libraries that might need it though,&amp;nbsp;so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;pip, virtualenv,&amp;nbsp;virtualenvwrapper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apt-get for Python, tool to manage isolated Python packages, and a wrapper to make using it&amp;nbsp;easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;upgrade&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;virtualenv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;virtualenvwrapper&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those command first install &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; from the software repository, then use &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; to update itself from the PyPI since the one in the software repository can be severely outdated, and then install &lt;code&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;virtualenvwrapper&lt;/code&gt;. To finish up installing &lt;code&gt;virtualenvwrapper&lt;/code&gt;, put this somewhere in the startup script (&lt;code&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; in my case). Of course change the path according the the&amp;nbsp;configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;WORKON_HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;venvs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PROJECT_HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Projects&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;virtualenvwrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Ruby&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t actually know how to program in Ruby. At All. But, there are a bunch of cools tools written in Ruby that are simply can&amp;#8217;t be replaced easily, things like &lt;a href="https://github.com/nex3/sass"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload"&gt;guard-livereload&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t want to spend too much time on this, so I just took the first guide I found and follow it. I am supposed to use &lt;a href="https//rvm.io"&gt;rvm&lt;/a&gt; to to manage the ruby versions. So, the stuff I&amp;nbsp;did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;curl -L https://get.rvm.io |&amp;nbsp;bash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And wait for it to finish, it might take a while. In my case, I ran into an error about it not being able to install some of the requirements, so what I did was check the log, and take the stuffs that failed to install and install them manually via apt-get. Worked for me. After it is done doing its things, put this somewhere in the startup&amp;nbsp;script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rvm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rvm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, install the version of ruby you want to&amp;nbsp;use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rvm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.9.3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;rvm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.9.3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is done. Maybe install some essential&amp;nbsp;gems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bundler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;guard&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Node.js&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am actually not sure what I am going to do with Node.js, but it is an interesting piece of technology with its full-async execution model. So, I just installed it, maybe I&amp;#8217;ll play with it at sometime. There are many ways to install node.js on a linux system. The official way is to download and install it from source, but since I am don&amp;#8217;t want to spend too much time dealing with something that I am not sure I will use anyway, I installed it from an un-official&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPA&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ppa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;chris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nodejs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And that will install &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; as well. kind of like &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; of the node.js world I&amp;nbsp;guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Others&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mono&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open source .&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NET&lt;/span&gt; implementation. Ability to use the awesome C# and&amp;nbsp;MonoGame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mono&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;complete&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Android-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I am going to need this sooner or later, but dealing with Java isn&amp;#8217;t just my favorite thing to do. I think the new Android Studio is supposed to make installing the SDKs and Android system images easier without having to deal with eclipse plugins and stuff, but still, removing OpenJDK, installing Oracle-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JDK&lt;/span&gt;, and stuff&amp;#8230; later, I&amp;nbsp;guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if I want to install this. The hype around it has been drawing my attention to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="linux"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="ruby"></category><category term="node"></category></entry><entry><title>More fun with Linux</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/more-fun-with-linux" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-11T13:04:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-06-11:blog/more-fun-with-linux</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Terminal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best feature of a Linux system is its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; tools, so of course, the terminal is an important tool to have. My first choice was &lt;a href="http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html"&gt;urxvt&lt;/a&gt;, it was lightweight, supports unicode, have quite an active community with various customization with it, and it doesn&amp;#8217;t have a menu bar, which is perfect for the i3wm I am using. Copy and pasting aren&amp;#8217;t as straightforward as I hoped, as I need to setup some script to get the basic function working, but I could live with that. The deal breaker problem is that it for some weird reason produces weird text artifacts when I resizes the window, which is really important to me, since one of the main the reason I am using a tiling window manager is for the flexibility and ability to quickly resize windows using&amp;nbsp;keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I settled for Terminator. It wasn&amp;#8217;t ideal, it was rather packed with features I don&amp;#8217;t really need, such as tabs and split windows. I have no need for these features, as I am already using a tiling window manager anyway. But at least it works, and it got a bad ass&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#8217;t much of a terminal to customize, so I only set the font type, hid the title bar, and changed the color scheme. I wrote a &lt;a href="https://github.com/hdra/itermcolors2terminator"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; to convert iTerm color schemes to the terminator palettes, since seems like the iTerm users enjoy a great list of color schemes&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don&amp;#8217;t really need to change my shell to anything other than what was provided as the default (that is, bash). Its not like I have overgrown bash and need something more powerful anyway. But, since all the cool people are saying &lt;a href="http://fendrich.se/blog/2012/09/28/no/"&gt;how&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://mikegrouchy.com/blog/2012/01/zsh-is-your-friend.html"&gt;awesome&lt;/a&gt; it is, so I jumped on the &lt;a href="http://www.zsh.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZSH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bandwagon anyway. And it turns out, it really is cool, among other things, one that I enjoy the most is its autocompletion. Just awesome. I was about to dive deeper and have fun customizing almost every aspects of it, but somewhere along the way, I&amp;nbsp;realized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendra2392/9014788639/" title="its a trap by p.hdra, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8275/9014788639_93815e99c4_o.jpg" width="197" height="256" alt="its a trap"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am about to spend too much time customizing the system again. So, I simply turned to the awesome &lt;a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh"&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/a&gt; package, the default is more than good enough for me, all I need to do is to just add a couple of extra lines to the &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file to set some alias and environment&amp;nbsp;variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Text&amp;nbsp;Editor&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few times I tried to work in Linux, I never really tried to setup a nice text editor to use. Big mistake. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMO&lt;/span&gt; the text editor is the most important tool in a programmer&amp;#8217;s pocket. Last time, I settled with something way too simple, such as gedit, or something way too complex to get to work, vim. No need to say, I never even got any real productivity working in&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the I have a wonderful text editor that I have been using from Windows. Yep, &lt;a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/"&gt;Sublime Text 2&lt;/a&gt;. It really is the best text editor I have ever used. The plugins, the themes and color schemes, and the community around it are simply awesome. Even without any plugin, it is still a solid text editor, with its command palette, multi-cursor, and many others. Best thing of all? It is cross-platform, available on all 3 major OSes, not the Mono or Java kind of cross platform, but a native application all way&amp;nbsp;through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing it in Linux, it is pretty straightforward, downloading it from the website, extracting it, and thats it. For those who are too lazy to go to the website and download the archive, there is this command that you can&amp;nbsp;use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;wget&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime Text 2.0.1 x64.tar.bz2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;vxjf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sublime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bz2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is also an unofficial repository maintained by the people at&amp;nbsp;webupd8:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ppa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;webupd8team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sublime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sublime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next thing, adding the the executable to path so that it can be easily&amp;nbsp;started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;~/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sublime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sublime_text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is a problem with the script above though. Running the command on the terminal will make the shell to wait for the program to exit, making us unable to do anything else on that terminal. So, to fix that, I made a little script to run it in the background, independent of the&amp;nbsp;terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;subl &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;gt; /dev/null &amp;amp;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I got to do left is to install the packages that I have been using on Windows. Installing my packages from Windows aren&amp;#8217;t that hard, since I installed my sublime text extras from the &lt;a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control"&gt;Package Control&lt;/a&gt;, all of my installed packages are listed in the &lt;code&gt;Package Control.sublime-settings&lt;/code&gt;, and the only thing left I need to do was to copy all my other configurations over, and just modify a little from the hotkey&amp;nbsp;configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Stack&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still do a lot of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; development, however uncool that may be nowadays. From messing around with WordPress and general web development, I still find &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; irreplaceable. I even intend to pick up &lt;a href="http://laravel.com/"&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt; to see what it can&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, easiest way to do it is of course, the combination of Apache web server, MySQL, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; stack. On Windows, I have been spoiled with ease of setup that is &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Good thing is, it is also available on Linux, but this time, I would like to take the opportunity to do it differently. I want to the parts manually so that I know how they work together. Fortunately, it is not that hard to setup on Linux, as most of the packages needed are readily available on the software&amp;nbsp;repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here are the packages needed, first of all, is the Apache web&amp;nbsp;server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By now, visiting &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; on your web browser should give you something to be happy about. Next thing to install is the&amp;nbsp;MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When the install is finished, you should get asked to perform the initial setup for the MySQL server, including setting up the user authentication and stuffs. Now the last piece of the stack is to install&amp;nbsp;php.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;php5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, for them to work together, there are a couple more packages to be&amp;nbsp;installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;libapache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;php5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;libapache2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;php5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;phpmyadmin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, restart apache with &lt;code&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart&lt;/code&gt;, and try to put some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; code in &lt;code&gt;/var/www&lt;/code&gt; and navigate to the address to see if it executed properly. Also, add this line to &lt;code&gt;/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;extension=mysql.so&lt;/code&gt; to get &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; to work with MySQL. Also, add the line &lt;code&gt;Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/etc/apache2/apache2.conf&lt;/code&gt; so that the server know where to find phpmyadmin. Restart the server again, and the server is set to&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the server is ready to use, but there are still a few things to do to make it pleasant to use. One is the document root of the apache web server is located at the not so easy to access location of &lt;code&gt;/var/www&lt;/code&gt;, so its better to move that to somewhere inside the home directory. To do that. the file to edit is &lt;code&gt;/etc/apache2/sites-available/default&lt;/code&gt;. It should be pretty obvious which lines to edit once you open that file. Also, while this might not be necessary, you can create an alias for &lt;code&gt;/etc/init.d/apache2&lt;/code&gt; so that it can be easily&amp;nbsp;accessed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="linux"></category></entry><entry><title>WordPress is big</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/wordpress-is-big" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-07T11:22:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-06-07:blog/wordpress-is-big</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, WordPress is big. Yes, that sounds silly, I know how &lt;a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress-stats/"&gt;big&lt;/a&gt; WordPress is, I just never really cared about the opportunity that it provides. I am currently looking for some freelance work to do, and I was pretty disappointed that most of what I found are WordPress jobs. Not that there is any problem with that, it was a wonderful blogging software, but it is a terrible &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;. As it tries to be more of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;, a terrible &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; that is hard to work with is what we have. That is the reason why I would prefer to write a web app from scratch rather than bending WordPress to do what I want, it is just too much work, and for some reason people seems to prefer using WordPress for everything. The other day, I received a request to write an event management website with WordPress. I am not confident that I can do that, since I honestly had a hard time understanding its&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I uploaded my &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/mog"&gt;Mog&lt;/a&gt; WordPress theme to the wordpress.org theme directory, I didn&amp;#8217;t have much expectation. It was just a side project that I did for fun, and honestly, it was my first try on building a WordPress theme for myself (I was blogging on WordPress.com at the time). To be honest, it wasn&amp;#8217;t that good of an experience. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; are kind of messy, in no small part are caused by having to accommodate a large variety of use cases by its even larger user base. Somewhere along the way I got fed up and decided to just build the things that I need. So, I left out custom menus support, ability to customize the theme via the WordPress option, and I don&amp;#8217;t even style the drop down menu properly, since I wasn&amp;#8217;t planning to have any nested&amp;nbsp;menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, few days ago, I noticed that the theme has reached 10.000 downloads. I know, that given WordPress&amp;#8217; scale, that number is nothing. It is nowhere near the number of some &amp;#8220;popular&amp;#8221;WordPress plugin or theme. Still, it is kind of different knowing that something that I made was interesting enough that it was downloaded by that many&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendra2392/8975138966/" title="Screenshot (141) by p.hdra, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5345/8975138966_64de8e9581.jpg" width="433" height="500" alt="Screenshot (141)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to think that something that I initially considered good enough for me to use, is nowhere near good enough for public consumption, so I decided to start working on the theme again, and make it better. Starting by fixing some of the problems I mentioned above. I still hate how messy the WordPress &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; is, but it also got me thinking, maybe I should give it a more serious consideration. Even though it is not very likely, I still hope that the WordPress team can consider redesigning the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. There are some &lt;a href="http://john.onolan.org/ghost/"&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; that seems promising, but while I am sure they are all great projects, I don&amp;#8217;t see it can replace WordPress anytime soon. So, I guess it&amp;#8217;s time to open up the WordPress books&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="wordpress"></category></entry><entry><title>Setting up my Linux to be less ugly</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/making-my-new-linux-less-ugly" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-01T14:57:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-06-01:blog/making-my-new-linux-less-ugly</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href="http://hndr.me/blog/linux-again"&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; to setup a new Linux installation that is lightweight, customizable to my taste, can be made look pretty, and of course, usable, I started looking around for the suitable&amp;nbsp;setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing I need to decide on is which Linux distribution to use. I can either look for something bare bone like the Arch, and then build up everything I need, or I can just take something that is ready to use, like Ubuntu, and take out whatever I don&amp;#8217;t need and replace anything I don&amp;#8217;t like. I am tempted to take the former approach, but looking at some youtube videos on the stuffs I would need to do, there seems to be just way too many things to do before I can even do anything. Even for basic things like network access needs to be setup. So, well, no thanks. Maybe next&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up deciding on the distribution I am familiar with, Linux Mint 13 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XFCE&lt;/span&gt;. Now, even as it is, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XFCE&lt;/span&gt; distribution is lightweight enough for me to use smoothly. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look bad, and it is very customizable. I was tempted to settle on it, but for some reason, I had frequent crashes during my use with it. Anyway, it is good enough for me to use as a&amp;nbsp;base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been read a lot about tiling window manager, and has been wanting to try it out. &lt;a href="http://www.xmonad.org"&gt;XMonad&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the one that is mentioned most frequently, but setting it up seems like a pain. Not to mention the  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;500MB&lt;/span&gt; I am supposed to download with it. I found another option, &lt;a href="http://www.i3wm.org"&gt;i3&lt;/a&gt;. And it seems to be a lot easier to setup and use. The configuration is done with plain text file instead of a scripting language like Haskell as is the case with XMonad. People had good things to say about how easy it is to use as well. Once I saw the video demo, I am&amp;nbsp;sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Wx0eNaGzAZU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Installing&amp;nbsp;i3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing i3 is easy enough. It is listed in the Ubuntu package repository, so it is also available for Linux Mint that is based on Ubuntu, but I find the version available in the repository to be severely outdated and have some problem with rendering some fonts, so installing the latest stable version from i3&amp;#8217;s repository is recommended. The instruction on their download page is easy enough to&amp;nbsp;follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# echo &amp;quot;deb http://debian.sur5r.net/i3/ $(lsb_release -c -s) universe&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# apt-get update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# apt-get --allow-unauthenticated install sur5r-keyring&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# apt-get update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# apt-get install i3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One thing to take notice here is the first line, which is used to add the repository to our sources. Only problem is, the &lt;code&gt;lsb_release -c -s&lt;/code&gt; in my system will output &lt;code&gt;maya&lt;/code&gt;, since that is indeed what my system is. That will cause the link to return me an 404, since, of course, the repository was meant for Ubuntu, and there is not Ubuntu version code named &lt;code&gt;maya&lt;/code&gt;. Since I know Linux Mint 13 was build on Ubuntu Precise, I can just replace it with&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# echo &amp;quot;deb http://debian.sur5r.net/i3/ maya universe&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After the installation is done, I log out, log in again, this time selecting i3 in the session manager, and I am&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making it less&amp;nbsp;ugly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the box, i3 looks pretty hideous. I didn&amp;#8217;t take any screenshot because at that point I haven&amp;#8217;t even figured out how to take a screenshot yet. But it is just a black screen with a little black bar at the bottom anyway. In any case, it is time to to do some makeover. The documentation for the i3 is really clear and nice to read. So, there wasn&amp;#8217;t much problem to figure out what to do. The configuration file is stored at &lt;code&gt;~/.i3/config&lt;/code&gt;. First thing to change is the color. I don&amp;#8217;t know much about design, but I do know when to avoid using the pure black and pure white color. Thing #1 to change: the window title&amp;nbsp;color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;focused&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;096&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mo"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAA7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mo"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DA8E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;focused_inactive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;333333&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;5F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;676&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ffffff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;484e50&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unfocused&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;333333&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;424242&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;888888&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;292&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d2e&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;urgent&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C10004&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;900000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ffffff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;900000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next, the status bar. I prefer mine on top of the screen. Also, the&amp;nbsp;color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status_command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i3status&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;tray_output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LVDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;232323&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;statusline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DCDCDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next thing, time to change that 80s font&amp;nbsp;face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mono&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By now, it looks much better. Next is the wallpaper. I use &lt;code&gt;feh&lt;/code&gt; to set my&amp;nbsp;wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;startup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;feh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hdra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Pictures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Wallpapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;jpg&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is how the &amp;#8216;desktop&amp;#8217; looks like right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendra2392/8910945270/" title="desktop by p.hdra, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3665/8910945270_db72193fae_c.jpg" width="800" height="447" alt="desktop"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Setting up&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now my desktop doesn&amp;#8217;t look half bad, but if I open any gtk-based application, especially gtk3 application, it looks like complete crap. So, next thing to deal with is the gtk theme and icons. The configuration file for gtk2 is located at &lt;code&gt;~/.gtkrc-2.0&lt;/code&gt;, while for gtk3 is located at &lt;code&gt;~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini&lt;/code&gt;. I want the applications to look consistent, so I had to look for one that can provide similar looks for both. There are some of the built-in theme that can do this, but I want something else. I decided on the MediterraneanLight from &lt;a href="http://www.gnome-look.org"&gt;gnome-look&lt;/a&gt;. I also picked up an icon set from there. Next thing to do is to change the font. I never liked how fonts in Linux &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; are always unnecessarily big. So, I switched to a lower font&amp;nbsp;size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my gtk2&amp;nbsp;configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gtk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;MediterraneanLight&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;gtk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Open Sans 8&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;gtk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Faenza-Dark&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And here is the gtk3&amp;nbsp;configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Settings]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;gtk-theme-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;MediterraneanLight&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;gtk-font-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Open Sans 8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;gtk-fallback-icon-theme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Mint-X&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;gtk-icon-theme-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Faenza-Dark&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now here is how it looks&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendra2392/8910222885/" title="marlin by p.hdra, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5459/8910222885_22f206f546_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="marlin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is some more screenshots with the tiling in&amp;nbsp;action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendra2392/8901630850/" title="capt-2013-05-31-193656 by p.hdra, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3724/8901630850_57c45b5fd2_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="capt-2013-05-31-193656"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is on setting it up to be more&amp;nbsp;usable!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Setting up my Linux on my laptop, changing my approach</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/linux-again" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-29T20:57:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-05-29:blog/linux-again</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I tried again and again to setup a Linux &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; on my laptop, hoping to eventually making it my main operating system, but, again and again, I find it just not practical enough. There was always something that doesn&amp;#8217;t work correctly. Things like programs that kept crashing, windows that suddenly froze, drivers not working, or simply, everything being sluggish. All that time, I always kept thinking that Linux on desktop is good enough to be used the same way I use Windows, or maybe, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSX&lt;/span&gt;. I was wrong. So, why am I doing this again this time? Well, for one thing, final exams are coming, and I should be studying instead of messing with my computer, so yeah, that dreadful &amp;#8216;P&amp;#8217; word. But, other than that, I also want to try a different approach this&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual pitch with Linux on desktop is that they are no longer hard to use as they used to. They require less resources to run. They can be made whatever you want them to. Truth: the ones that are user friendly are nowhere near lightweight, and many of them aren&amp;#8217;t even that configurable by design, in the name of user friendliness. I do believe that overall, they are all moving to the right direction. Especially the work Linux Mint team done with &lt;a href="http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com"&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; has been very exciting. Canonical has also been hard at work with Ubuntu, coming up with all kinds of stuff that makes Linux more and more viable as a desktop &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;. They even plan to develop &lt;a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/03/canonical-announce-custom-display-server-mir-not-wayland-not-x"&gt;their own display server&lt;/a&gt;. The trends are going towards an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; that is tightly integrated, better hardware support, and of course, easier to use. Customizability might be the only thing that are going away. I personally don&amp;#8217;t really care for it, as long as they work well enough for me, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t really need to configure much&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems like easy enough for me to just pick a distribution and use it. Too bad, it is not that simple for me. Here are some of my problem with the existing &amp;#8216;mainstream linux&amp;#8217;: * I mentioned that the ability to configure the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t matter that much to me, as long as it works well enough. Problem is, none of them are good enough, so my only option is to use one that I can customize to suit my use.
&lt;em&gt; My laptop is almost 4 years old. It runs Windows 8 smoothly. It can even run some of the recent heavyweight games with no problem. But, surprisingly,  believe it or not, running vanilla Ubuntu with Unity doesn&amp;#8217;t come without noticeable lags. I believe the hardware drivers play quite a part in this. Looking around, seems like most people seems pretty happy with the open source graphic card driver, so I guess its time for me to upgrade, but, I am still saving up.
&lt;/em&gt; Related to my first point, in my attempt trying to bend the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; to suit my taste, many things became a tangled mess. This makes unexpected things to stop working during unexpected times. Since many of the distribution tried to make things easy to use, many things became hidden away. This also makes it hard to reproduce the configuration because I am not even sure what I&amp;nbsp;changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with all that in mind, I decided how I want this attempt on using Linux would be:
&lt;em&gt; Lightweight. A must. I don&amp;#8217;t think I can use an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; that aren&amp;#8217;t at least as fast as Windows.
&lt;/em&gt; Customizable. I think I was looking for the wrong thing if I focus on ease of use when trying out Linux out of the box. For now. This time, I would look for something that may requires some configuration overhead, but overall, would make everything easier to use.
&lt;em&gt; Works. Of course, By this I mean I don&amp;#8217;t want having to install codecs to play music, or not audio jack not working, having to dig for drivers for wireless card, multi-monitor configuration, etc.
&lt;/em&gt; Doesn&amp;#8217;t hide things from me. I want to know what is going on in as many places as possible. As little magic as possible. I want to be able to reproduce my configuration easily.
&lt;em&gt; Makes me more productive. The whole point of me thinking to switch to Linux is so that I can do things, especially programming related things, faster, easier, and better. I want to take full advantage of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNIX&lt;/span&gt;. I want to use as many keyboard shortcuts as possible. I don&amp;#8217;t expect this to be there out of the box, but I want it to be at least configurable to achieve this.
&lt;/em&gt; Looks good. I don&amp;#8217;t need shiny and fancy, but at the very least, I don&amp;#8217;t want it to be unbearably&amp;nbsp;ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I can&amp;#8217;t simply blame everything on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;. There are also mistakes in the way I approached this in the past. I just expected everything to work without making an effort to know what is happening behind the scene. So, this time, here is how I am going to do it.
&lt;em&gt; No configuration tool such as ubuntu-tweak and such. If there is a file that I need to edit, I want to know what it is, and how to change it.
&lt;/em&gt; Read the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;. I always avoided having to read the help page of most tools, as I preferred to just have the command to enter presented to me via the great wisdom of Google.
&lt;em&gt; Take it slow. No need to rush to make the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; for me to use. Making sure things work properly is the priority.
&lt;/em&gt; Document everything. I want to know the steps I took to achieve something, and I want to make sure it can be easily reproduced. Maybe write a build script for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that covered, I have some plan in mind on how to do it. Lightweight, customizable, reasonably low-level, stable, friendly. Next will be on setting it up. By the way, while I was writing this post, Linux Mint 15 &amp;#8220;Olivia&amp;#8221; was announced! and look at &lt;a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/rel_olivia_whatsnew.php"&gt;them&lt;/a&gt;! So pretty! This can be harder than I expected with that kind of&amp;nbsp;temptation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>My First GitHub Pull Request!</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/my-first-github-pull-request" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-28T11:44:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-04-28:blog/my-first-github-pull-request</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just had my first pull request! It was a change to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes"&gt;Pelican themes&lt;/a&gt;, where I added this &lt;a href="https://github.com/hdra/pelican-cait"&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt; to the directory there. So, yeah, I didn&amp;#8217;t actually contribute a patch to an existing project, it was simply adding my repo to the list of&amp;nbsp;theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned about the whole pull request process itself. Of course, it is not that complicated in the first place anyway. Basically it involves forking the source repo, create a new branch, make changes on that branch, commit, push to github, and then after the new branch is created on github, there will be an option to initiate a pull request there. It is that&amp;nbsp;simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually drafted this post around a week ago when I sent the pull request, and it just got merged to the master branch earlier today, so here I am updating this&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, anyway, I got to say, it feels pretty good! and it is also quite a motivation booster for me.&amp;nbsp;:D&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Setting up my GitHub Pages</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/setting-up-my-github-pages" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-26T16:50:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-04-26:blog/setting-up-my-github-pages</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Previously, I had been hosting this site from Heroku. It was pretty simple to setup, I can just create an &lt;code&gt;index.php&lt;/code&gt; file, then add another &lt;code&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; file to the root of the site, push, and done. In this case, I maintained two separate repositories, one that contains the Pelican project, including the configuration file, the build script, etc. The other repositories contains the generated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I recently wanted to try hosting the site on GitHub Pages. Hosting on GitHub pages requires the content of my site to be in the root of &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch. Of course, this would be simple enough if I just keep the project files and the generated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; files in separate repositories just like I did before, but I would like to keep them in the same repository, and have a build script to do everything for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, it is not that simple to achieve that. The most straightforward way to do this is to create or checkout the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch, generate the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; files on the same directory, commit, and push as usual. But this would make the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch contains some of the project files. Not a big problem, but it just doesn&amp;#8217;t feel too clean of a solution. I also tried other methods, but none of them feels satisfactory. Ideally, I wanted to have a solution similar what was done with &lt;a href="https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import"&gt;ghp-import&lt;/a&gt;, but there are some problems that prevents me from using it. I tried looking at the source of the project, in attempting to understand how it works and try to do the same things manually, but well, it seems like my Git-fu are insufficient to understand it. In the end, ended up doing the things similar as what outlined &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisjacob/833223"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Basially, I am keeping the branches of the same repository in separate directories, but instead of keeping the as a siblings, I made the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch as a child of the child directory of the project. Here is the fabric file I used to build the&amp;nbsp;post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;fabric.api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;configurations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;output_dir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;OUTPUT_PATH&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;remote_git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;git@github.com:hdra/hndr.me.git&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;activate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Scripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;activate.bat&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;git push origin gh-pages&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That seems to work pretty cleanly so far. One problem is when creating a new project and its &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch for the first time. In my case, I dealt with it by creating the a new branch as usual, and then deleting the project files in the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch manually, but I think it can be done by creating an orphan page with the &lt;code&gt;git checkout --orphan gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; command as well. Anyway, this needs to be done only once, so it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be too much of a&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>New Site Design!</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/new-site-design" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-13T19:33:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-04-13:blog/new-site-design</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finally got to converting the last site design I made to a Pelican theme. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/hdra/pelican-cait"&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt; should be in use by the time this post is published. In its current state, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t say the theme is compeletely finished. I tried to make it responsive to screen size changes, but during my testing, I found some problem viewing it in iOS Safari when there is a long line of continuos text in the page. For some reason &lt;code&gt;overflow-wrap: break-word;&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to work in it, even though it works fine in Chrome and Firefox for&amp;nbsp;Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, the are also a lot of repetition and duplicate codes in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; and Jinja2 template. The templates in particular aren&amp;#8217;t very flexible. There are a number of values that needs to be specified in the configuration file for it to be usable. Pages also can&amp;#8217;t be listed the normal way since I turned one of the page template into the index page for my&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, I think it is ready to be put out there. If I sit on it any longer, I am pretty sure I would lose interest in it pretty soon. As they say, &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/12/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway.html"&gt;ship early, ship often&lt;/a&gt;.

Probably because of I have been trying to write a Pelican theme for my own website. For My own use, I wanted the website to have a landing page, and also another design for the blog index. I made another attempt at the design recently. Here is the landing&amp;nbsp;page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendra2392/8636534196/" title="Screenshot (69) by p.hdra, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8254/8636534196_ac410cec50_c.jpg" width="800" height="414" alt="Screenshot (69)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and here is the blog&amp;nbsp;index:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendra2392/8636534164/" title="Screenshot (70) by p.hdra, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8519/8636534164_497989410e_c.jpg" width="800" height="415" alt="Screenshot (70)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also managed to made the design responsive. Kind of. I just made the sidebar go to the top of the page when the window is resized to below 800 pixels of&amp;nbsp;width.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendra2392/8635873575/" title="Snap 2013-04-10 at 12.49.21 by p.hdra, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8248/8635873575_153dd6e05e_b.jpg" width="317" height="1024" alt="Snap 2013-04-10 at 12.49.21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design itself is currently still a static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; page that I made on top of the pretty cool &lt;a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML5&lt;/span&gt; Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. For some reason I got a feeling that I am not using it to its full potential, as I don&amp;#8217;t really utilizes anything from it beyond the basic page structure and the included &lt;code&gt;normalize.css&lt;/code&gt;. Obviously I am doing something wrong. One thing that I notice in the main &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; file is this&amp;nbsp;line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;screen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;35em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I knew about the media query and used it before, but I used to use it with the &lt;code&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt; instead. So, the idea here is to design for the mobile version first, then make the necessary changes for the larger screen. I have heard about this mobile-first approach a lot before, and I am aware of the arguements for and against it, but I never really gave it any thought, mostly because I am not doing any serious front-end stuff anyway, but I am thinking of trying this approach for my next try on web&amp;nbsp;design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also planning to play around more with front-end development. The past few days trying to make the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; page to look exactly how I want it to look like made me realize that I don&amp;#8217;t really know much about front-end development. Most of the time, web-development for me consists of dealing with generating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; page from the server and maybe make a Javascript function to make a server call to change the page dynamically, but I never really go deep into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; itself. Looking into more than tools and frameworks that I can use to make the job&amp;nbsp;easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as mentioned before, the designs above are still in a static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; form, and I think it is good enough for me to use. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll turn it into a proper Pelican theme&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="programming"></category><category term="design"></category></entry><entry><title>Still Working</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/still-working" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-03T17:16:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-04-03:blog/still-working</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been a few weeks since I decided to start blogging again, but well, as usual not much has been done on it. For starter, I initially planned to host it on Heroku, following the tricks outline &lt;a href="http://kennethreitz.org/exposures/static-sites-on-heroku-cedar"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and it is super simple to setup. I had created a new Heroku app, generated the blog, and pushed the generated content to Heroku in just a few minutes. In another minute, and I had setup the custom domain and had everything working&amp;nbsp;nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem is, even though the site itself is just a bunch of static files, the first time I visited the site, it took a few seconds to load the content, but when I visit it again for the second time, it served the site almost immediately. At first, I thought it was because of the site is cached by the browser, so it loads much quicker, but even when I cleared the browser cache, it still loads the same way. After a bit of googling, I &lt;a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; out that Heroku will turn off the dyno after an hour of inactivity, so everytime I visit the site after a period of idling, the dyno will need to be started again at that time. Not much of a problem, considering I am not even paying for the amazing service that Heroku provide, and there &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5480337/easy-way-to-prevent-heroku-idling"&gt;ways&lt;/a&gt; to get around it anyway. I probably won&amp;#8217;t be using it, since I am still playing around with the hosting options around&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other popular service that people use to host their static site seems to be &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;. After looking around on how to set it up, seems like it is pretty easy to set it up. The Pelican makefile even includes a build option for this setup. The site will be hosted in a repository just like any other git repo, but the site index will need to be on the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch. In other words, the content of the site will be open source. Not a problem though, since any webpage that are publicly accessible are basically open source anyway. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll move the site here after I am done setting the website&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On building the site itself, I just converted some of my old wordpress posts to Markdown, which should be published along with this post. The automatic converter doesn&amp;#8217;t work too well, since many of posts contains some really badly formed markups, so I ended up manually converting the most of posts. I also took the chance to just remove many of the rants/silly posts, not saying that there aren&amp;#8217;t any silly posts left&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still playing around with the pelican configurations and options, on how to setup different static pages, building a theme, etc. Speaking about the theme, I drafted a theme of my&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendra2392/8615163439/" title="Snap 2013-04-01 at 11.50.50 by p.hdra, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8394/8615163439_30ea63f405_c.jpg" width="800" height="788" alt="Screenshot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I liked it quite a bit, but after leaving it there for a few days, when I came back to work on it again, I found it to be not very attractive anymore. So, no need to say, I scrapped it, and started working from scratch. This time, planning the overall sites, starting from the landing page, static pages, comments, and of course the blog itself. Of course, it won&amp;#8217;t be around anytime soon. For the time being, the default Pelican theme seems more than good enough for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>Hello, Pelican</title><link href="http://hndr.me/blog/hello_pelican" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-15T13:19:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-03-15:blog/hello_pelican</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, it has been a while since I posted anything or do anything with my website for that matter. I think I haven&amp;#8217;t posted anything since I moved to wordpress.com, but well, its time to start playing&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, again, I moved almost everything. Hosting, domain, and also the blogging platform. I have been wanting to try out some of the static site generator for a while now. The most popular one seems to be &lt;a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. It is built on Ruby, and seems like a lot of people are using it. Problem is, it is kind of a pain to setup on Windows, and I wanted to be able to built things for it, or at least my own theme for my blog, and my knowledge of Ruby doesn&amp;#8217;t go too far beyond the Hello World. So I continued my search, this time, specifically looking for a static site generator built on something that I can program in, maybe it is C#, Javascript, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;, or of course&amp;nbsp;Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed I found quite a lot of awesome projects for Python. The most famous one seems to be &lt;a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde"&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt;. One problem though, the documentation seems to be severely lacking. I went through the website for almost an hour, and I barely have any idea on how to use and customize it. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll take another look at it when my Python skills have&amp;nbsp;improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I found &lt;a href="http:///www.github.com/getpelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;. It is also written in Python, and it&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; is just delightful. It shows you how to get started easily, and also how to customized it as needed. Simply awesome. It is also super easy to setup. There is also a Make configuration file that can be used to automate a bunch of stuffs, but the basic commands are easy enough to use. There is a also a script to import data from other blogging platforms, which maybe I&amp;#8217;ll take a look at&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
