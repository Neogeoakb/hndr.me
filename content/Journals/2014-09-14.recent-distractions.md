Title: Recent Distractions
Date: 2014-09-13 22:53

Its a Saturday night, and I have nothing else to do. Hence, this post.

Stuff I am distracted by these days:

Side Projects, Travelling.

Data processing and analysis, data mining, data visualisation.

Bootstrapped business, recurring revenue, marketing.

DDD, automated tests, software design patterns.

That's about it. I don't know what will come out of it, or what will end up distracting me from it.
