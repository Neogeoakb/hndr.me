I just had my first pull request! It was a change to the [Pelican theme][l1], where I added
this [theme][l2] to the directory there. So, yeah, I didn't actually contribute a patch to an
existing project, it was simply adding ny repo to the list of theme.

I also learned about the whole pull request process itself. Of course, it is not
that complicated in the first place anyway. Basically it involves forking the source repo,
create a new branch, make changes on that branch, commit, push to github, and then after the new
branch is created on github, there will be an option to initiate a pull request there. It is that
simple.

But, anyway, I got to say, it feels pretty good! and it is also quite a motivation booster for me. :D
