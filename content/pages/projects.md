Title: Projects

Some of the stuff that I work/ play on. Mostly available on [github][ghme] along with several
other projects.

# Current Projects

## Web

### [Cait][cait]
Another first. A theme for the Pelican. Kind of responsive, consists of mostly black, gray,
and white.

### [Mog][mog]
My first finished WordPress theme. A simple single column theme that put focuses on the
content, so there location of the sidebars aren't really well placed. Haven't got the time
to make it responsive though.

# Retired Projects

## Windows Phone

*Warning*: Awful codes inside. These was written quite a while ago, when I was beginning to 
learn to program, and I just can't bother to deal with it. Most of these are developed for
the Windows Phone 7, haven't updated them to Windows Phone 8, because my PC can't run the new
devtools, also because I am lazy.

### [PicPin][picpin]
Some random WP photos geolocation stuff mapping app.

### [Demotivator][dem]
Demotivational poster creator for Windows Phone 7.

### [Swatch 7][swatch]
Color picker app for Windows Phone 7.
