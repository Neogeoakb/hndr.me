I enjoy programming in general. I generally code in C#, sometimes also Python, Javascript or PHP. 
I also dabble in web development with HTML/CSS. I am interested in a wide range of software deveopment
related thing, mobile apps, game development, design, computer science, etc. Sometimes getting too
easily distracted by the shiny new technology being put out by someone.

I also like to browse the web for design inspirations, have been taking baby steps in learning to design,
starting by designing my own website myself.
Photography is another thing that I like to spend my time on, although I am terrible at it.

Currently, I am a computer science student at the University of Technology, Malaysia, expecting to
graduate by the end of 2013.
