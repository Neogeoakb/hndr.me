                        <p>Well, WordPress is big. Yes, that sounds silly, I know how <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress-stats/">big</a> WordPress is, I just 
never really cared about the opportunity that it provides. I am currently looking for some
freelance work to do, and I was pretty disappointed that most of what I found are WordPress
jobs. Not that there is any problem with that, it was a wonderful blogging software, but
it is a terrible <span class="caps">CMS</span>. As it tries to be more of a <span class="caps">CMS</span>, a terrible <span class="caps">API</span> that is hard to work
with is what we have. That is the reason why I would prefer to write a web app from scratch
rather than bending WordPress to do what I want, it is just too much work, and for some reason
people seems to prefer using WordPress for everything. The other day, I received a request
to write an event management website with WordPress. I am not confident that I can do that, 
since I honestly had a hard time understanding its&nbsp;<span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
<p>When I uploaded my <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/mog">Mog</a> WordPress theme to the wordpress.org theme directory, I didn&#8217;t
have much expectation. It was just a side project that I did for fun, and honestly, it was 
my first try on building a WordPress theme for myself (I was blogging on WordPress.com at
the time). To be honest, it wasn&#8217;t that good of an experience. The <span class="caps">API</span> are kind of messy, 
in no small part are caused by having to accommodate a large variety of use cases by its
even larger user base. Somewhere along the way I got fed up and decided to just build the
things that I need. So, I left out custom menus support, ability to customize the theme via
the WordPress option, and I don&#8217;t even style the drop down menu properly, since I wasn&#8217;t 
planning to have any nested&nbsp;menu. </p>
<p>Then, few days ago, I noticed that the theme has reached 10.000 downloads. I know, that given
WordPress&#8217; scale, that number is nothing. It is nowhere near the number of some &#8220;popular&#8221;
WordPress plugin or theme. Still, it is kind of different knowing that
something that I made was interesting enough that it was downloaded by that many&nbsp;people.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendra2392/8975138966/" title="Screenshot (141) by p.hdra, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5345/8975138966_64de8e9581.jpg" width="433" height="500" alt="Screenshot (141)"></a></p>
<p>I came to think that something that I initially considered good enough for me to use, is
nowhere near good enough for public consumption, so I decided to start working on the 
theme again, and make it better. Starting by fixing some of the problems I mentioned above.
I still hate how messy the WordPress <span class="caps">API</span> is, but it also got me thinking, maybe I should
give it a more serious consideration. Even though it is not very likely, I still hope 
that the WordPress team can consider redesigning the <span class="caps">API</span>. There are some <a href="http://john.onolan.org/ghost/">projects</a> that seems promising, but while I am sure they are all great projects, I don&#8217;t see it can replace
WordPress anytime soon. So, I guess it&#8217;s time to open up the WordPress books&nbsp;again.</p>
